# Vietnam-traffic-sign-recognition

🇻🇳 Vietnamese Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically recognize Vietnamese traffic signs from images. It aims to support intelligent transportation systems, driver assistance, and traffic law enforcement by accurately detecting and classifying traffic signs.

🧠 Features

📷 Image-based classification of Vietnamese traffic signs.

🧱 Built with TensorFlow/Keras CNN architecture.

🎯 Trained on Vietnamese traffic sign datasets, including common categories such as:
- Cấm (Prohibitory signs)
- Nguy hiểm (Warning signs)
- Hiệu lệnh (Mandatory signs)

📊 Achieves high accuracy on validation data.

📁 Organized code for preprocessing, training, and inference.

🔧 Technologies
+ Python 3.10.0
+ TensorFlow / Keras
+ OpenCV
+ NumPy, Matplotlib.
